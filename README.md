# Commit 1 
# As of 2/26/2025 I used part of the file reader code and I will edit it so that it works as a contact book. 


# Commit 2
# I asked the ai "does the program correctly creates a new CSV file for the contact book?" and the ai responded No, the program does not create a new CSV file for the contact book. It creates a text file named contact.txt instead. If you want to create a CSV file for the contact book, you need to modify the code to handle CSV file operations. Here is an updated version of the code that creates and manages a CSV file named contacts.csv:
# The AI then edited the code so that it met what was checked for. I plan on doing this for the rest of the required features.
# the code wasn't opening a contacts.csv code so it closed and cleared some things and when I ran the code again, it opened up a contacts.csv
# I asked the ai if it "Open and read multiple different contact books (this will require prompting the user which contact book they want to open)" and the ai added the missing code but the code didn't print what contact book you want to open. I need to make sure the code prompts "which contact book do you want to use with two options names "contacts1" and "contacts2" that is prompted after you choose an option.
# I fixed the code so that instead of needing to type out the whole file name to select it you just have to type 1 or 2.
